# Colour_detection
## Overview

This Project is used to detect various colours that are present in a picture.The image path can be given as an argument while running the code.py file or can be defined in the code itself.Using the colors.csv dataset,we can feed the open cv model with the information regarding colours.Using open cv,the image is then opened and whenever the event of "double click" happens,it outputs the closest colour to the co-ordinates of the cursor that it can detect .
